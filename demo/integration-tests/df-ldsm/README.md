# Airflow demo

Demonstration of Airflow running inside a Vagrant Virtual machine.

## Installation

* install [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) version 2.2.0 or better. On Ubuntu you can use the script ./common/scripts/bootstrap.sh
* install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) version 5.0 or better
* install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) version 1.8.5 or better
* install vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager

  ```
     vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
  ```
* start the virtual machine with Vagrant. You will need at least 5Gb of RAM available for the VM.

  ```
    vagrant up
  ```

### Troubleshooting

#### VirtualBox is complaining that the installation is incomplete

After upgrading the Linux kernel in your system you may encounter this message when running a Vagrant command:

```
The provider 'virtualbox' that was requested to back the machine
'airflow' is reporting that it isn't usable on this system. The
reason is shown below:

VirtualBox is complaining that the installation is incomplete. Please
run `VBoxManage --version` to see the error message which should contain
instructions on how to fix this error.
```

To fix it, you need to rebuild a module for Virtualbox using this command:

```
  sudo apt-get install --reinstall virtualbox-dkms linux-headers-generic
```

## Usage

The virtual machine should start and install Airflow.

You can see Airflow running at [localhost:14080](http://localhost:14080)

Marathon can be accessed on [localhost:15080](http://localhost:15080)

PostgresRAW UI should be accessible from [localhost:15555](http://localhost:15555)

## Testing

Example data is provided in /data/demo folder inside the VM, but the preprocessing pipelines
cannot work at the moment as they require Matlab installed.

The ./data/ldsm folder is mapped to the Query Engine and any CSV file present in this folder will be automatically registered and visible as a table.

### Configuration for Ansible inventory

Ansible inventory controls what software is installed and how it is configured.

It is organised by hosts (servers) and groups.

Here, we have the following organisation:

* demo: the target host, running inside a Vagrant Virtual machine
* managed: a group containing demo, indicating that the server is managed by Ansible and should be applied a default configuration and a set of base sofware packages
* control: a group containing demo, indicating that this server is used to perform operations affecting the whole cluster (here we have a 'cluster' of one machine)
* zookeeper, mesos-mixed: groups that are used to define where and how the Mesos stack is deployed
* airflow: groups that are used to define which applications should be deployed by Marathon
