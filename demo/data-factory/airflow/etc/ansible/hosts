# Control node: one control node should be selected, not necessarily in the datacenter - it can be the local desktop -
# but it should satisfy the following requirements:
# - direct network access to all services on the datacenter, in particular the databases and Marathon
# - Docker available on the control node
# - Install required packages (docker-py, curl...) for proper function of the Ansible tasks
